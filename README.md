Kroniki Elevena is a Polish RPG game.
I started working to make this, because I saw video of [FNaFBAP](https://github.com/Scrungip/FNaFBAP) by [Scrungip](https://github.com/Scrungip) and I thought it was really cool and gave me an idea to make something similar.

Kroniki Elevena ap is in very early development and is not playable yet.

Do note that this game is not, and never will be, supported by the main Archipelago team.
This game is not permitted to be run or discussed in the official Archipelago Discord servers under any circumstances.
